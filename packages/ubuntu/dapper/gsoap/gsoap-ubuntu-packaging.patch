+           The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,
+           royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
+           intellectual property claims:

+                        under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by

+                        Modifications, or portions thereof, but solely to the
+                        extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary
+                        to enable You to utilize, alone or in combination
+                        with other software, the Original Code,
+                        Modifications, or any combination or portions
+                        thereof.
+                (c)
+                (d)
+   2.2. Contributor Grant.
+           Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each

+                (a)
+                        under intellectual property rights (other than patent

+                        unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
+                        Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
+                (b)
+                        under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
+                        Contributor, to make, have made, use and sell ("offer

+                        portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any
+                        such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to
+                        utilize, alone or in combination with other software,
+                        the Contributor Version (or portions thereof).
+                (c)
+                (d)
+
+3  DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.
+
+   3.1. Application of License.
+           The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
+           governed by the terms of this License, including without
+           limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code
+           may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
+           future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You
+           must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
+           Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
+           Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
+           version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
+           However, You may include an additional document offering the
+           additional rights described in Section 3.5.
+
+   3.2. Availability of Source Code.
+           Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial
+           Developer in Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the
+           License.
+
+   3.3. Description of Modifications.
+           You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
+           a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered
+           Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
+           statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
+           indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer
+           and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
+           Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
+           documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
+           Covered Code.
+
+   3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
+                (a) Third Party Claims.
+                        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
+                        third party's intellectual property rights is
+                        required to exercise the rights granted by such
+                        Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
+                        must include a text file with the Source Code
+                        distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim
+                        and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
+                        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
+                        Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
+                        Modification is made available as described in
+                        Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the
+                        LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
+                        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
+                        notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
+                        reasonably calculated to inform those who received
+                        the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
+                        obtained.
+                (b) Contributor APIs.
+                        If Contributor's Modifications include an application
+                        programming interface and Contributor has knowledge
+                        of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
+                        implement that API, Contributor must also include
+                        this information in the LEGAL file.
+                (c) Representations.
+                        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
+                        pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor
+                        believes that Contributor's Modifications are
+                        Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor
+                        has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
+                        this License.
+   3.5. Required Notices.
+           You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
+           Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
+           particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
+           include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
+           where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You
+           created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
+           Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
+           duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
+           where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
+           to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
+           warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
+           more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
+           Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
+           Contributor.
+
+   3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
+           You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
+           requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
+           Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
+           ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
+           terms different from this License, provided that You are in
+           compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for
+           the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
+           recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set
+           forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version
+           under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
+           any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
+           not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute
+           executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product,
+           you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation
+           and/or other materials provided with the product.
+
+   3.7. Larger Works.
+           You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
+           code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
+           Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
+           sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
+           Covered Code.
+
+   3.8. Restrictions.
+           You may not remove any product identification, copyright,
+           proprietary notices or labels from gSOAP.
+
+4  INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.
+
+   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
+   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
+   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
+   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in
+   the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
+   distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
+   statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for
+   a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5  APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.
+
+   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
+   the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
+
+6  VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.
+
+   6.1. New Versions.
+           Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
+           from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
+           version number.
+
+   6.2. Effect of New Versions.
+           Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
+           the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
+           that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under
+           the terms of any subsequent version of the License.
+
+   6.3. Derivative Works.
+           If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
+           may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
+           Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your
+           license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any confusingly similar
+           phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your
+           license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
+           that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from
+           the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
+           Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
+           Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
+           this License.)

+gsoap for Debian 
+----------------
+
+You can link your programs with -lgsoap++ for C++ projects created with
+soapcpp2 and you can link with -lgsoap for C projects generated with
+soapcpp2 -c.
+
+There are also corresponding libraries for cookie-support (-lgsoapck
+and lgsoapck++) available.
+
+The include file stdsoap2.h has been installed under /usr/include. If
+you want to compile a header file that was generated by wsdl2h, you
+need to supply the path to gsoap header files when invoking soapcpp2,
+like this:
+
+	soapcpp2 -I /usr/include/gsoap mywsdl.h
